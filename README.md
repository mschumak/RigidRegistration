# RigidRegistration
  
This plugin is designed to register a source image to a target image automatically. It uses DenseSIFT features and does not require downsampling of the images.

## Notes
This plugin works with images with different sizes and resolutions. Currently the user should execute the steps very slowly to let the memory completely release between the steps. This issue will be fixed in future.
